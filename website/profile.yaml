  about: |
    Throughout my professional career I have developed different skills, in recent years I have focused my personal development on different new methodologies that approach IT systems from a methodological and procedural point of view.    
    
    My job is mostly about understanding processes and transforming them into code, which involves code and infrastructure. Making it so that repetitive tasks are no longer necessary.
